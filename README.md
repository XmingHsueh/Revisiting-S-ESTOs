# How to Exploit Optimization Experience? Revisiting Evolutionary Sequential Transfer Optimization: Part B - Empirical Studies

This repository provides the MATLAB implementations of empirically investigating a wide variety of knowledge transfer techniques in the context of S-ESTO via five research questions (RQs). Particularly, different knowledge transfer techniques associated with the five RQs are organized from a component perspective of S-ESTO, including solution selection, solution adaptation, and the integration of them. The five RQs are organized from the component perspective and provided as follows:

|Component|Research Questions|
|:-|:-|
|Solution Selection|RQ1: How do existing similarity metrics perform in solution selection for S-ESTO?|
|Solution Selection|RQ2: Which factor is essential to the effectiveness of similarity metrics in S-ESTO?|
|Solution Adaptation|RQ3: How do existing adaptation techniques perform in solution adaptation for S-ESTO?|
|Solution Adaptation|RQ4: What contributes to the effectiveness of solution adaptation models in S-ESTO?|
|Integration of Selection and Adaptation|RQ5:  How to integrate solution selection and solution adaptation for S-ESTO?|

The first two RQs aim to investigate similarity metrics in selection-based approaches while the third and fourth RQs focus on adaptation models in adaptation-based approaches. To curb the negative transfer, solution selection and solution adaptation can be integrated. The last RQ focuses on investigating this integration.
