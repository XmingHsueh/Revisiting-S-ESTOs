# How to Exploit Optimization Experience? Revisiting Evolutionary Sequential Transfer Optimization: Part B - Empirical Studies

This repository provides the MATLAB implementations of empirically investigating a wide variety of knowledge transfer techniques in the context of S-ESTO via five research questions (RQs). Specifically, different knowledge transfer techniques associated with the five RQs are organized from a component perspective of S-ESTO, including solution selection, solution adaptation, and the integration of them.
